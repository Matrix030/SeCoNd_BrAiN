At the heart of HTTP is a simple request-response system. The "requesting" computer, also known as the ["client"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_\(computing\)), asks another computer for some information. That computer, ["the server"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_\(computing\)) sends back a response with the information that was requested.

We'll talk about the specifics of how the "requests" and "responses" are formatted later. For now, just think of it as a simple question-and-answer system.

- Request: "What issues are on Jello?"
- Response: ["Fix bug", "Improve auth flow"]

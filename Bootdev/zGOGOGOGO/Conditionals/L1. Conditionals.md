`if` statements in Go do not use parentheses around the condition:

```go
if height > 4 {
    fmt.Println("You are tall enough!")
}
```

`else if` and `else` are supported as you might expect:

```go
if height > 6 {
    fmt.Println("You are super tall!")
} else if height > 4 {
    fmt.Println("You are tall enough!")
} else {
    fmt.Println("You are not tall enough!")
}
```

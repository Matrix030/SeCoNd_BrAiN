[Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) systems (like the one you're using) support multiple users. Each user has their own home directory, their own files, and their own permissions.

If you're like most people these days, you're the only user on your machine. It used to be more common for multiple people to share a single computer, or for multiple people to do their work on the same computer over a network.

## Sudo

The `sudo` keyword lets you run a command as a "superuser". It's short for ["superuser do"](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/linux-101-introduction-sudo/). To use it, you'll need a password with superuser privileges, which you should already have if you're the only user of your machine.

Some people are pedantic and pronounce `sudo` as "sue-doo". Others are correct and pronounce it "sue-dough".

`sudo` grants unrestricted access and can risk system damage if you don't know what you're doing. All commands in this course are safe, but other commands should be reviewed before running with `sudo`.

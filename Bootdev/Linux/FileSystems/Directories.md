As we mentioned before, a directory is just a location in a filesystem that can contain files and other directories. On some systems, directories are called "folders", but it's the same thing.

## The mkdir Command

The ["make directory" command](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=m-mkdir-command) creates a new directory inside the current directory.

```bash
mkdir my_directory
```

## Assignment

During your digging, you find that a file appears to be out of place!

1. [ ] Make sure you're in the `worldbanc/public/products/credit_cards` directory
2. [ ] Run `ls` from there. You should see a file called `tbills.txt`. Treasury Bills (T-Bills) are a type of investment, not a credit card!
3. [ ] Go back to the `products` directory and create a new directory called "investments".
4. [ ] List the contents of the `products` directory again to confirm that the new directory was created.

Paste the contents of the `products` directory into the input field and submit it.

You're probably familiar with the concept of files from using a GUI like Windows Explorer or Finder.

At their core, files are just blobs of data. The raw bytes in a file can represent anything: text, images, videos, etc.

## The cat Command

The `cat` command is used to view the contents of a file. It's short for "concatenate", which is a fancy way of saying "put things together". It can feel like a confusing name if you're using the `cat` command to view a single file, but it makes more sense when you're using it to view multiple files at once.

```bash
# Print the contents of a file to the terminal
cat file1.txt
```

```bash
# Concatenate the contents of multiple files and print them to the terminal
cat file1.txt file2.txt
```

So far you've been likely working in the default terminal that came with your operating system, and that's fine. However, there are other options, and I want to highlight a couple of them just in case you want to check them out (but you don't have to).

## Editor/IDE Built-In Terminals

Most text editors for developers have a built-in terminal.

For example, [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Zed](https://zed.dev/), and Cursor are popular text editors that also have a built-in terminal. While I do use Zed's terminal for most of my coding work, in this course, I do _not_ recommend using a built-in terminal because we don't need the extra text editor features.

## Ghostty

[Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) is a _very_ new terminal emulator that differentiates itself by being fast, feature-rich, and native. It's a great option if you love to customize, and want a modern, fast, and feature-rich terminal.

## Alacritty

[Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) is another popular terminal emulator that is known for its speed and extensibility. Before Ghostty, Alacritty was the go-to terminal for many developers who wanted a fast and customizable terminal.

## Windows Terminal

[Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9N0DX20HK701?rtc=1&hl=en-us&gl=US) is Microsoft's substitute for the Linux terminal. Use the "cmd.exe" program settings to change the default terminal. Be sure to start WSL whenever you open a new terminal window.

You'll often want to re-run a command. You could just type it out again, but assuming you don't have the [WPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_per_minute) of [ThePrimeagen](https://www.boot.dev/teachers/the-primeagen), that's a pain.

## Arrow Keys

You can use the up and down arrows to quickly cycle through your command history.

Focus your terminal window and use the "up" arrow key to start cycling through your command history. If you recently restarted your shell, then type a few commands first, like:

```bash
echo hello
echo world
```

Once you've cycled back through your history with the "up" arrow, you can use the "down" arrow to cycle back to the most recent command.

## Clear

If your terminal is feeling cluttered with text, you can clear it with the `clear` command, or by pressing `ctrl + l`.

This won't _delete_ your history, it will just clear the screen.

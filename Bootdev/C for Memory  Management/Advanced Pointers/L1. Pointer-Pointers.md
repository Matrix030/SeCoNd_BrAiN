Ok, so... now we know what pointers are. So let's learn it over again! A pointer-to-pointer in C is just a pointer variable that holds the address of another pointer.

Your browser does not support playing HTML5 video. You can instead. Here is a description of the content: Pointer pointers are easy

This allows you to create complex data structures like arrays of pointers, and to modify pointers indirectly. The syntax is exactly what you would expect:

```c
int value;
int *pointer;
int **pointer_pointer;
```

Pointers to pointers (or pointers to pointers to pointers to pointers... you get the idea) are like a treasure map or a scavenger hunt. You start at one pointer and keep following the chain of addresses until you get to the final value. It's just a chain of dereferences.

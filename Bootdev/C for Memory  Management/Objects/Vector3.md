`Vector3` is going to be the first Snek Object that can hold a reference to another Snek Object. It's a collection type: a type that holds other types.

Arrays, lists, dictionaries, and sets are all examples of collection types. We won't implement all of those types in this course, but they each will follow the same pattern that we're establishing here with `Vector3`.

`Vector3` is similar to a Python tuple that contains _exactly_3 "SnekObject" elements.

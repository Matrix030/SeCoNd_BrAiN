- ❓ Which features to **keep**
- ❌ Which features to **discard**
##  Why Not Use All Features?

### 1. Garbage In, Garbage Out
- More variables ≠ better model.
- Irrelevant or noisy features can **confuse** the model and **decrease accuracy**.
- Including everything blindly can lead to **overfitting** or a **garbage model**.
### 2.  Interpret-ability & Communication
- You’ll need to **explain** your model:
    - Why it works
    - What each variable means
- If you have 1,000 features, this becomes **impossible to present** to a boss or stakeholder.
- Models are more **useful** when their logic is **understandable**.

### ✅ Goal of Feature Selection
 Keep only the **most important** variables—those that genuinely **predict** the outcome.
- Enhances model **performance**
- Increases **transparency**
- Makes it easier to **defend** your results in meetings or reports

## Regression Trees

Scatter plot of a dataset
2 independent variable (x1, x2)

- y (depended) - to be predicted - third dimension (sticking out of your screen)

When the alogrithm is run a few splits happen

How are they conducted are did by the algorithm (information entropy)

is the split increasing amount of information, does it add value?

Once everything is plotted we predict Y
by adding splits we add information.

## 🌳 Decision Trees: Regression Trees (CART)
### 📘 What is CART?
- **CART** = _Classification and Regression Trees_
- Umbrella term for:
    - **Classification Trees** (predict categories)
    - **Regression Trees** (predict numerical values)
> This section focuses on **Regression Trees**, which are more complex but powerful for predicting continuous variables.

### 🎯 Goal
To predict a **continuous output** y, using one or more **input features** (e.g. x1,x2x_1, x_2x1​,x2​) by segmenting the input space and assigning a prediction to each segment.
### 🧱 Dataset Structure
- Input: Two features → x1​, x2​
- Target: One dependent variable → y
- Visualized as a **scatterplot in 2D** (x1 vs x2), with y being the third dimension we don’t see

### ✂️ How Regression Trees Work
#### Step-by-step:
1. **Start with all data points**  
    (You don’t need to see the output yyy yet — just the feature space)
2. **Split the feature space** based on thresholds in x1x_1x1​, x2x_2x2​
    - Example splits:
        - x1<20x1 < 20x1​<20
        - x2<170x_2 < 170x2​<170
        - x2<200x_2 < 200x2​<200
        - x1<40x_1 < 40x1​<40
3. **Continue splitting** until:
    - No significant gain in information (via entropy or variance reduction)
    - Minimum leaf size is reached
    - Max depth or other stopping criteria are met
4. **Each terminal leaf** represents a **segment** of the input space
    
### 🧮 What’s in Each Leaf?
Each terminal leaf stores the **average of y-values** for the data points that fall into it.
So:
- Any **new data point** passed to the tree is routed to a **leaf**
- That leaf returns the **average y** as the prediction
### 🌐 Conceptual Advantage
> Instead of using one global average of yyy, the tree breaks the space into **regions with local averages**.  
> This increases **prediction accuracy** by leveraging the structure in the input space.

### 📉 Default vs. Tree-based Prediction

|Method|Output Strategy|
|---|---|
|No model|Always return **mean(y)**|
|Regression Tree|Return **mean(y)** from the matched **leaf**|

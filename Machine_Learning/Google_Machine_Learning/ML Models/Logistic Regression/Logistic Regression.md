**Learning Objectives**

- Identify use cases for performing logistic regression.
- Explain how logistic regression models use the sigmoid function to calculate probability.
- Compare linear regression and logistic regression.
- Explain why logistic regression uses log loss instead of squared loss.
- Explain the importance of regularization when training logistic regression models.


In the [Linear regression module](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/linear-regression), you explored how to construct a model to make continuous numerical predictions, such as the fuel efficiency of a car. But what if you want to build a model to answer questions like "Will it rain today?" or "Is this email spam?"

This module introduces a new type of regression model called [**logistic regression**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#logistic_regression) that is designed to predict the probability of a given outcome.

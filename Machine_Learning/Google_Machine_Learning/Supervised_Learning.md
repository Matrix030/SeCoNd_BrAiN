## Foundational supervised learning concepts

Supervised machine learning is based on the following core concepts:

- Data
- Model
- Training
- Evaluating
- Inference

### Dataset characteristics

A dataset is characterized by its size and diversity. Size indicates the number of examples. Diversity indicates the range those examples cover. Good datasets are both large and highly diverse.

Datasets can be large and diverse, or large but not diverse, or small but highly diverse. In other words, a large dataset doesn't guarantee sufficient diversity, and a dataset that is highly diverse doesn't guarantee sufficient examples.

For instance, a dataset might contain 100 years worth of data, but only for the month of July. Using this dataset to predict rainfall in January would produce poor predictions. Conversely, a dataset might cover only a few years but contain every month. This dataset might produce poor predictions because it doesn't contain enough years to account for variability.

The _basic_ data types in JavaScript are:

- [`boolean`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean): a boolean value, either `true` or `false`
- [`string`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String): a sequence of characters
- [`number`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number): represents both integer and floating-point (fractional) numbers
- [`undefined`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined): a variable that has not been assigned a value

There are a few others of course, but we'll cover those as they come up.

## Declaring Variables

There are several ways to declare variables in JavaScript, and we'll talk about some of the _better ways_ in a second, for now, let's do it the _old_ way. Here are some examples of variables with the types we just discussed:

```javascript
var isTall = true;
var isCool = false;

var name = "Alice";

var age = 42;

var weight = 150.5;

var brainSize = undefined;
```

The `undefined` value is a special value in JavaScript that represents the absence of a value.

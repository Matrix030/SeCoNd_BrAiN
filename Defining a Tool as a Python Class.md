This approach involves creating a subclass of [`Tool`](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/v1.8.1/en/reference/tools#smolagents.Tool). For complex tools, we can implement a class instead of a Python function. The class wraps the function with metadata that helps the LLM understand how to use it effectively. In this class, we define:

- `name`: The tool’s name.
- `description`: A description used to populate the agent’s system prompt.
- `inputs`: A dictionary with keys `type` and `description`, providing information to help the Python interpreter process inputs.
- `output_type`: Specifies the expected output type.
- `forward`: The method containing the inference logic to execute.

Below, we can see an example of a tool built using `Tool` and how to integrate it within a `CodeAgent`.

Alfred’s party at the mansion is a **superhero-themed event**, but he needs some creative ideas to make it truly special. As a fantastic host, he wants to surprise the guests with a unique theme.

To do this, he can use an agent that generates superhero-themed party ideas based on a given category. This way, Alfred can find the perfect party theme to wow his guests.

```python
from smolagents import Tool, CodeAgent, InferenceClientModel

class SuperheroPartyThemeTool(Tool):
    name = "superhero_party_theme_generator"
    description = """
    This tool suggests creative superhero-themed party ideas based on a category.
    It returns a unique party theme idea."""

    inputs = {
        "category": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The type of superhero party (e.g., 'classic heroes', 'villain masquerade', 'futuristic Gotham').",
        }
    }

    output_type = "string"

    def forward(self, category: str):
        themes = {
            "classic heroes": "Justice League Gala: Guests come dressed as their favorite DC heroes with themed cocktails like 'The Kryptonite Punch'.",
            "villain masquerade": "Gotham Rogues' Ball: A mysterious masquerade where guests dress as classic Batman villains.",
            "futuristic Gotham": "Neo-Gotham Night: A cyberpunk-style party inspired by Batman Beyond, with neon decorations and futuristic gadgets."
        }

        return themes.get(category.lower(), "Themed party idea not found. Try 'classic heroes', 'villain masquerade', or 'futuristic Gotham'.")

# Instantiate the tool
party_theme_tool = SuperheroPartyThemeTool()
agent = CodeAgent(tools=[party_theme_tool], model=InferenceClientModel())

# Run the agent to generate a party theme idea
result = agent.run(
    "What would be a good superhero party idea for a 'villain masquerade' theme?"
)

print(result)  # Output: "Gotham Rogues' Ball: A mysterious masquerade where guests dress as classic Batman villains."
```
With this tool, Alfred will be the ultimate super host, impressing his guests with a superhero-themed party they won’t forget! 🦸‍♂️🦸‍♀️

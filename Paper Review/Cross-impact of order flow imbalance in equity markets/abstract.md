investigation the impact of order flow imbalance (OFI) on price movements in equity markets in a multi-asset setting.

## Content:
systematic approach for combining OFI's at the top levels of the limit order book into an integrated OFI variable which better explains price impact, compared to the best-levels OFI.

## Results:
- Once the information from multiple levels is integrated into OFI, multi-asset models with cross-impact do not provide additional explanatory power for contemporaneous impact compared to a sparse model without cross-impact terms. 
- On the other hand, lagged cross-asset OFIs do improve the forecasting of future returns.
- This lagged cross-impact mainly manifets at short-term horizons and decays rapidly in time.

Secure software requires a secure development lifecycle, some form of secure design pattern, paved road methodology, secured component library, tooling, and threat modeling. Reach out for your security specialists at the beginning of a software project throughout the whole project and maintenance of your software. Consider leveraging the [OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)](https://owaspsamm.org) to help structure your secure software development efforts.

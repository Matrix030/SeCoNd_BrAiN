Security logging and monitoring came from the Top 10 community survey (#3), up slightly from the tenth position in the OWASP Top 10 2017. Logging and monitoring can be challenging to test, often involving interviews or asking if attacks were detected during a penetration test. There isn't much CVE/CVSS data for this category, but detecting and responding to breaches is critical. Still, it can be very impactful for accountability, visibility, incident alerting, and forensics. This category expands beyond _CWE-778 Insufficient Logging_ to include _CWE-117 Improper Output Neutralization for Logs_, _CWE-223 Omission of Security-relevant Information_, and _CWE-532_ _Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File_.

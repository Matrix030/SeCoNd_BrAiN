# Common Weakness Enumeration

In **layman's terms**, it's like a **catalog of common coding mistakes** that can lead to security problems in software.

### 💡 **Imagine this analogy:**

You're building a house (software), and CWE is a **checklist of construction flaws** (like weak doors, unsealed windows, or exposed wiring) that burglars (hackers) might use to break in.

---

### 🔐 More technically:

- **CWE is maintained by MITRE**, a U.S. nonprofit that works with cybersecurity.
    
- Each CWE entry describes a **specific type of security flaw**.
    
- It doesn’t list specific vulnerabilities (that’s CVE), but rather **types or categories of coding errors**.
    

---

### 🔧 Example:

- **CWE-89**: SQL Injection — A common mistake where an app trusts user input too much and lets them run harmful SQL commands.
    
- **CWE-79**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) — When a web app doesn't clean up user input, allowing someone to inject malicious scripts.
    

---

### ✅ Why it’s important:

- Helps **developers avoid common mistakes**.
    
- Helps **security teams evaluate risks** in applications.
    
- Used in **secure coding guidelines**, tools like **Static Analysis**, and compliance requirements.

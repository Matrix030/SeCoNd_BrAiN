Shifting up one position to #2, previously known as _Sensitive Data Exposure_, which is more of a broad symptom rather than a root cause, the focus is on failures related to cryptography (or lack thereof). Which often lead to exposure of sensitive data. Notable Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) included are _CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password_, _CWE-327: Broken or Risky Crypto Algorithm_, and _CWE-331 Insufficient Entropy_.

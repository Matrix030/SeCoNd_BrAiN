All the data stored on your computer is organized into files and directories. Files and directories are organized into a tree-like structure called a filesystem.

- Directories (or "folders" on Windows) are just containers that hold files and other directories.
- Files are just a dump of raw binary data: 1's and 0's. The bytes in a file can represent anything: text, images, videos, etc.

The filesystem tree starts with a single directory called the [root directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_directory). The root directory contains files and directories, which can contain more files and directories, and so on.

When you open your terminal, your _working directory_ (the one you're "in") is going to be... **somewhere**. Most commonly it is your ["home" directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory).

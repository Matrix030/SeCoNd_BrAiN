In other Boot.dev courses you may have run your code by clicking a "Run" button. But as a realâ„¢ developer, you'll likely run your code using a command line interface (CLI) instead. For example, in Python, you would run a Python code file like this:

```bash
python main.py
```

## What's a CLI?

You'll often hear the terms "terminal", "shell", "command line", "CLI", and "command prompt" used interchangeably (despite some technical differences) to refer to the same thing: a program that allows you to interact with your computer in a text-based way.

## What's a GUI?

If you don't have a technical background, you're probably used to interacting with your phone or computer using a [graphical user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) (GUI). When you use a mouse to click on fancy icons, buttons, and menus, you're using a GUI.

To be fair, it's usually easier to teach people to use a GUI than a CLI. You can simply point to things and say "click here" or "drag this there". But GUIs do have some drawbacks:

- **They're weak.** You are given much more control over your computer through a CLI. With a GUI you're limited to the options that the developer of the GUI has given you.
- **They're slow.** Once you know the commands to type, it's much faster to type them than to click through endless menus with a mouse.
- **They're not as reproducible.** If you want to share a set of instructions, you can just copy and paste commands without worrying about screen sizes and user preferences.
- **They're not automatable.** It's easy to write code that manipulates text (as you've seen in Python), but it's much harder to write code that manipulates GUIs.
- **They're not as cool.** You will be invited to 90% fewer romantic outings if you are a GUI user.

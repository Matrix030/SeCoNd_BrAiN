As we talked about, the terms "shell", "CLI", and "terminal" are often used to refer to the same thing: a program for issuing text-based commands.

But to get pedantic, the "terminal" is just one _specific part_ of that program. Historically, the word "terminal" meant a physical device that you could type commands into, essentially a keyboard and a screen.

These days, when we say "terminal", we really mean "terminal _emulator_". A terminal emulator is a program that emulates a physical terminal. It's a program that lets you type commands into a window on your computer.

_Which_ commands you're able to use isn't determined by the _terminal emulator_, but by the _shell_, which we'll talk about later.

_Your terminal emulator is just responsible for drawing text on the screen and processing your keystrokes._

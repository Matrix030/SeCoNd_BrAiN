So far all we've seen are the _simple_ (non-collection) types in C. However, stuff like this can get really annoying:

```c
int main() {
    int x_1 = 1;
    int y_1 = 2;
    int z_1 = 3;
    int x_2 = 4;
    int y_2 = 5;
    int z_2 = 6;

    int dist = distance(x_1, y_1, z_1, x_2, y_2, z_2);
    printf("Distance: %d", dist);
}
```

Because our distance function starts to look... ridiculous.

```c
int distance(int x_1, int y_1, int z_1,
             int x_2, int y_2, int z_2)
{
    // a lot of numbers
}
```

We also run into a new problem: _In C, we're only allowed to return a single value from a function_. This doesn't work:

```c
int int int scale_coordinate(int x, int y, int z, int scale) {
    return x * scale, y * scale, z * scale;
    // Error! Too many values to return
}
```

_[Structs](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/struct) solve this._ Here's an example of the syntax:

```c
struct Human {
    int age;
    char *name;
    int is_alive;
};
```

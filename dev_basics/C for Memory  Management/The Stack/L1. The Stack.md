Remember how I told you that memory is basically just a giant array of bytes with addresses at various offsets?

That's true, but it also has some additional structure. In particular, memory is divided into two main regions: the **stack** and the **heap**. We'll cover the heap later.

The stack is where local variables are stored. When a function is called, a new **stack frame** is created in memory to store the function's parameters and local variables. When the function returns, its entire stack frame is deallocated.

The stack is aptly named: it is a **stack** (the "Last In, First Out" data structure) of memory frames. Each time a function is called, a new frame is pushed onto the stack. When the function returns, its frame is popped off the stack.

Take a look at this example function:

```c
void create_typist(int uses_nvim) {
  int wpm = 150;
  char name[4] = {'t', 'e', 'e', 'j'};
}
```

Say we call `create_typist(1)`. Before the call, our stack memory might look like this, with the next memory address to be used `0x0004`:

Once called, the [stack pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_pointer) is moved to make room for:

- The [return address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_statement) (to pick up execution after the function returns)
- Arguments to the function
- Local variables in the function body

and the local variables are stored in the stack frame:

When the function returns, the stack frame is deallocated by resetting the stack pointer to where the frame began.

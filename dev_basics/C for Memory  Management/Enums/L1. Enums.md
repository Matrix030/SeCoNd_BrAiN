Unlike [Golang](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-golang) (a language living in 1970), C has explicit support for `enum`s (enumerations) with the [`enum` keyword](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/enum).

TJ is salty because Go is a simple, modern language that companies ackshually use to ship products. Not all programming languages can be academic thought-experiments like OCaml.

You can define a new enum type like this:

```c
typedef enum DaysOfWeek {
  MONDAY,
  TACO_TUESDAY,
  WEDNESDAY,
  THURSDAY,
  FRIDAY,
  SATURDAY,
  FUNDAY,
} days_of_week_t;
```

The `typedef` and its alias `days_of_week_t` are optional, but like with structs, they make the enum easier to use.

In the example above, `days_of_week_t` is a new type that can _only_ have one of the values defined in the `enum`:

- `MONDAY`, which is 0
- `TACO_TUESDAY`, which is 1
- `WEDNESDAY`, which is 2
- `THURSDAY`, which is 3
- `FRIDAY`, which is 4
- `SATURDAY`, which is 5
- `FUNDAY`, which is 6

You can use the `enum` type like this:

```c
typedef struct Event {
  char *title;
  days_of_week_t day;
} event_t;

// Or if you don't want to use the alias:

typedef struct Event {
  char *title;
  enum DaysOfWeek day;
} event_t;
```

An `enum` is _not_ a collection type like a struct or an array. It's just a list of integers constrained to a new type, where each is given an explicit name.

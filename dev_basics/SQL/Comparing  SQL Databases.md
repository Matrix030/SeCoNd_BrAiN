Let's dive deeper and talk about some of the popular SQL Databases and what makes them different from one another. Some of the most popular SQL Databases right now are:

- [PostgreSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL)
- [MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL)
- [Microsoft SQL Server](https://db-engines.com/en/system/Microsoft+SQL+Server)
- [SQLite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite)
- [And many others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_relational_database_management_systems)

While all of these Databases use SQL, each database defines specific rules, practices, and strategies that separate them from their competitors.

## SQLite vs. PostgreSQL

Personally, SQLite and PostgreSQL are my favorites from the list above. Postgres is a very powerful, open-source, production-ready SQL database. SQLite is a lightweight, embeddable, open-source database. I usually choose one of these technologies if I'm doing SQL work.

SQLite is a serverless database management system (DBMS) that has the ability to run within applications, whereas PostgreSQL uses a Client-Server model and requires a server to be installed and listening on a network, similar to an HTTP server.

## We Use SQLite in This Course

In this course, we will be working with SQLite, a lightweight and simple database. For most backend web servers, PostgreSQL is a more production-ready option, but SQLite is great for learning and for small systems.

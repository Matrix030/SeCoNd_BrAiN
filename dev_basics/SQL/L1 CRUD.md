CRUD is an acronym that stands for `CREATE`, `READ`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`. These four operations are the bread and butter of nearly every database you will create.

## HTTP and CRUD

The CRUD operations correlate nicely with the HTTP methods we learned in the [Learn HTTP Clients](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-http-clients-golang) course.

- `HTTP POST` - `CREATE`
- `HTTP GET` - `READ`
- `HTTP PUT` - `UPDATE`
- `HTTP DELETE` - `DELETE`

A `constraint` is a rule we create on a database that _enforces_ some specific behavior. For example, setting a `NOT NULL` constraint on a column ensures that the column will not accept `NULL` values.

If we try to insert a `NULL` value into a column with the `NOT NULL` constraint, the insert will fail with an error message. Constraints are extremely useful when we need to _ensure_ that certain kinds of data exist within our database.

## Defining a NOT NULL Constraint

The `NOT NULL` constraint can be added directly to the `CREATE TABLE` statement.

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees(
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    -- The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each row in the table
    name TEXT UNIQUE,
    -- The UNIQUE constraint ensures that no two rows can have the same value in the 'name' column
    title TEXT NOT NULL
    -- The NOT NULL constraint ensures that the 'title' column cannot have NULL values
);
```

## SQLite Limitation

In other dialects of SQL you can `ADD CONSTRAINT` within an `ALTER TABLE` statement. SQLite does _not_ support this feature so when we create our tables we need to make sure we specify all the constraints we want! Here's a [list of SQL Features](https://www.sqlite.org/omitted.html) SQLite does not implement in case you're curious.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol _Secure_ or [HTTPS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/https) is an extension of the HTTP protocol. HTTPS secures the data transfer between client and server by [encrypting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Encryption) all of the communication.

HTTPS allows a client to safely share sensitive information with the server through an HTTP request, such as credit card information, passwords, or bank account numbers.

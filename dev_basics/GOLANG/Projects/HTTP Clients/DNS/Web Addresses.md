In the real world, we use physical addresses to help us find where a friend lives, where a business is located, or where a party is being thrown (well, I don't because I'm not invited to parties, but I digress).

In computing, web clients find other computers over the internet using [Internet Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol) (IP) addresses. Each device connected to the internet has a **unique IP address**.

## Domain Names and IP Addresses

When we browse the internet, we type in a human readable domain name. That domain is converted into an IP address. The IP address tells our computer where the server is located on the internet.

You may encounter the [PATCH](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PATCH) method from time to time. It's frankly not used very often. It's meant to _partially_ modify a resource, whereas `PUT` is meant to _completely replace_ a resource.

`PATCH` is not as popular as `PUT`, and many servers, even if they allow partial updates, just use `PUT`.

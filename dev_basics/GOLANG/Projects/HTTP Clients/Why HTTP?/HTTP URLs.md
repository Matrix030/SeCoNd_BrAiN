A URL, or [Uniform Resource Locator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL), is the address of another computer, or "server" on the internet. Part of the URL specifies _where to reach_ the server, and part of it tells the server _what information we want_.

Put simply, a URL represents _a piece of information on some computer somewhere_. We can get access to it by making a _request_, and reading the _response_ that the server replies with.

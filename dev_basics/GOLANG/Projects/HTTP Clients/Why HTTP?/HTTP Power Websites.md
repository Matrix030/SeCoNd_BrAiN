[HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview), or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is a [protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Protocol) designed to transfer information between computers.

There are other protocols for communicating over the internet, but HTTP is the most popular and is _particularly great for websites and web applications_. Each time you visit a website, your browser is making an HTTP request to that website's server. The server responds with all the text, images, and styling information that your browser needs to render its pretty website!

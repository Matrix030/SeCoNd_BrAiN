As we've discussed, a web client is a device making requests to a web server.

A client can be any type of device but is often something users physically interact with. For example:

- A desktop computer
- A mobile phone
- A tablet

In a website or web application, we call the user's device the "front-end".

A front-end client makes requests to a back-end server.

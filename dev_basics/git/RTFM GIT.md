One of the best parts of using [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is that all the [documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc) is fantastic, but that wasn't always the case.

Git was known as being the most obtusely documented tool of all time, but alas, _times have changed_.

## Assignment

Let's take a look at the official Git manual. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
man git
```

Shortcuts for the manual:

- `q`: Quits the manual
- `j`: One line down
- `k`: One line up
- `d`: Half page down
- `u`: Half page up
- `/<term>`: Search for "term"
- `n`: Next search term
- `N`: Previous search term

Search for the term `AUTHORS` (all caps) and answer the question.

In Python, numbers without a decimal part are called `Integers` and fractions are `Floats`. Contrast this to JavaScript where all numbers are just a [`Number`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number) type.

You're already familiar with the `number` type. Numbers aren't surrounded by quotes when created, but they can contain decimal parts and negative signs.

```javascript
let x = 2; // this is a number
x = 5.69; // this is also a number
x = -5.42; // yup, still a number
```

You can do arithmetic as you'd expect:

```javascript
let sum = 2 + 3 + 7; // 12
let difference = 5.3 - 2.1; // 3.2
let product = 2 * 3; // 6
let quotient = 6 / 2; // 3
```

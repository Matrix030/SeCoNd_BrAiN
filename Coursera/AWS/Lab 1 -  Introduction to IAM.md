### Lab Overview

![[Pasted image 20250717124011.png]]
You might receive error messages when performing actions beyond the steps provided in this lab guide. The lab relies on IAM, which limits your access to the services authorized for use in the lab. The error messages will not impact your ability to complete the lab.
### Icon key

Various icons are used throughout this lab to call attention to different types of instructions and notes. The following list explains the purpose for each icon:

- **Caution:** Information of special interest or importance (not so important to cause problems with the equipment or data if you miss it, but it could result in the need to repeat certain steps).
- **Consider:** A moment to pause to consider how you might apply a concept in your own environment or to initiate a conversation about the topic at hand.
- **Expected output:** A sample output that you can use to verify the output of a command or edited file.
- **File contents:** A code block that displays the contents of a script or file you need to run that has been pre-created for you.
- **Learn more:** Where to find more information.
- **Note:** A hint, tip, or important guidance.
- **Task complete:** A conclusion or summary point in the lab.
- **Warning:** An action that is irreversible and could potentially impact the failure of a command or process (including warnings about configurations that cannot be changed after they are made).

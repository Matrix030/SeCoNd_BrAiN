So the stack is great and all, but one of the downsides is that it has a limited size. If you keep pushing frames onto the stack without popping them off, you'll eventually run out of memory and get a [**stack overflow**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_overflow). (yes, that's what the [famous site](https://stackoverflow.com/) is named after)

That's one of the reasons recursion without [tail-call optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call) can be dangerous. Each recursive call pushes a new frame onto the stack, and if you have too many recursive calls, you'll run out of stack space.

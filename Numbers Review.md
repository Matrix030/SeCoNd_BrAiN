Remember, in JavaScript all numbers are just "number" types. There is no distinction between "Float" types and "Integer" types.

## Addition

```js
2 + 1;
// 3
```

## Subtraction

```js
2 - 1;
// 1
```

## Multiplication

```js
2 * 2;
// 4
```

## Division

```js
3 / 2;
// 1.5 (still just a "number")
```

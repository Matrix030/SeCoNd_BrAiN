according to their recent world hacker games appearance they use the following modules:

biometrics - facial and audio identify people and rule out deepface

standalone deepfake detection - hyper-tuned to look for any sort of facial forgery or any sort of audio deepfake being used. model that was trained by them. Once forgery is detected it is made next to impossible to remove that and pass the check. Must pass at the beginning otherwise the check is destined to fail. Zoom Filters don't affect the detection. Specifically added in the Elements during building of model (touch up effect, blurred backgrounds)

there is also liveness - Looking for - is there a real person on the screen, built almost as a second factor, because their tech does great job in live scenario by matching biometrics, this is a fallback as it might be a video instead (which might pass as it is a real version of the actual person) of a real person. This module is built in to make sure that if someone is actually present on the screen, its not a recorded video or a photo being played.

you and I are supposed to make a simple first module of biometric as stated in the instructions of this project chat.

I have made a simple MVP for the task which is given, here is the code:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile
from pydantic import BaseModel
from io import BytesIO
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
import cv2
import insightface

app = FastAPI()

# Initialize the InsightFace model for facial analysis
face_app = insightface.app.FaceAnalysis(name='buffalo_l')
face_app.prepare(ctx_id=0, det_size=(640, 640))  # Use GPU (ctx_id=0), with detection size 640x640

class Profile(BaseModel):
    """
    Pydantic model representing the structure of the profile response.
    """
    description: str

@app.post("/create-profile", response_model=Profile)
async def create_profile(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    """
    Endpoint to create a facial profile from an uploaded image.
    
    Args:
        file (UploadFile): The image file uploaded via a POST request.

    Returns:
        dict: A profile description containing facial metrics and landmarks.
    """
    img = Image.open(BytesIO(await file.read()))
    profile_description = analyze_face(img)
    return {"description": profile_description}

def analyze_face(image: Image.Image) -> str:
    """
    Analyzes a face in the input image and extracts facial metrics.
    
    Args:
        image (PIL.Image.Image): The input image containing a face.

    Returns:
        str: A human-readable profile description containing facial dimensions,
             ratios between key landmarks (eyes, nose, mouth), and detection confidence.
    """
    # Convert the PIL image to OpenCV BGR format
    img_array = np.array(image)
    img_bgr = cv2.cvtColor(img_array, cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR)
    
    # Detect faces in the image
    faces = face_app.get(img_bgr)
    
    if not faces:
        return "No face detected in the image."
    
    face = faces[0]  # Analyze the first detected face

    # Bounding box and landmarks
    bbox = face.bbox  # (x1, y1, x2, y2)
    landmarks = face.kps  # [(x, y), ...]

    # Compute face dimensions
    face_width = bbox[2] - bbox[0]
    face_height = bbox[3] - bbox[1]
    face_ratio = face_height / face_width

    # Compute eye distance and ratio to face width
    left_eye = landmarks[0]
    right_eye = landmarks[1]
    eye_distance = np.linalg.norm(right_eye - left_eye)
    eye_face_ratio = eye_distance / face_width

    # Compute nose vertical position relative to face height
    nose = landmarks[2]
    nose_y_pos = (nose[1] - bbox[1]) / face_height

    # Compute mouth width and ratio to face width
    left_mouth = landmarks[3]
    right_mouth = landmarks[4]
    mouth_width = np.linalg.norm(right_mouth - left_mouth)
    mouth_face_ratio = mouth_width / face_width

    # Compose a descriptive profile string
    profile = (
        f"Face dimensions: {face_ratio:.2f} height/width ratio. "
        f"Eye spacing: {eye_face_ratio:.3f} relative to face width. "
        f"Nose positioned at {nose_y_pos:.3f} vertical face ratio. "
        f"Mouth width: {mouth_face_ratio:.3f} relative to face width. "
        f"Landmark confidence: {len(faces)} face(s) detected."
    )

    return profile

Welcome to this module, where youâ€™ll learn **how to build effective agents** using the [`smolagents`](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents) library, which provides a lightweight framework for creating capable AI agents.
`smolagents` is a Hugging Face library; therefore, we would appreciate your support by **starring** the smolagents [`repository`](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents) :

## Module Overview

This module provides a comprehensive overview of key concepts and practical strategies for building intelligent agents using `smolagents`.

With so many open-source frameworks available, itâ€™s essential to understand the components and capabilities that make `smolagents` a useful option or to determine when another solution might be a better fit.

Weâ€™ll explore critical agent types, including code agents designed for software development tasks, tool calling agents for creating modular, function-driven workflows, and retrieval agents that access and synthesize information.

Additionally, weâ€™ll cover the orchestration of multiple agents as well as the integration of vision capabilities and web browsing, which unlock new possibilities for dynamic and context-aware applications.

In this unit, Alfred, the agent from Unit 1, makes his return. This time, heâ€™s using the `smolagents` framework for his internal workings. Together, weâ€™ll explore the key concepts behind this framework as Alfred tackles various tasks. Alfred is organizing a party at the Wayne Manor while the Wayne family ðŸ¦‡ is away, and he has plenty to do. Join us as we showcase his journey and how he handles these tasks with `smolagents`!

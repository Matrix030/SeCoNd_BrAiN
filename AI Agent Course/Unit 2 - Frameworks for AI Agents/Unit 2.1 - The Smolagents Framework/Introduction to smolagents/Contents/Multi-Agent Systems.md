Orchestrating multiple agents effectively is crucial for building powerful, multi-agent systems. By combining agents with different capabilities—such as a web search agent with a code execution agent—you can create more sophisticated solutions. This module focuses on designing, implementing, and managing multi-agent systems to maximize efficiency and reliability.

`ToolCallingAgents` are the second type of agent supported by `smolagents`. Unlike `CodeAgents`, which generate Python code, these agents rely on JSON/text blobs that the system must parse and interpret to execute actions. This module covers their functionality, their key differences from `CodeAgents`, and it provides an example to illustrate their usage.

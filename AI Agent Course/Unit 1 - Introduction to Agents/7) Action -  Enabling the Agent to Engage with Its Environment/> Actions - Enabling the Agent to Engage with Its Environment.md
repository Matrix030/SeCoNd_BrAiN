Actions are the concrete steps an **AI agent takes to interact with its environment**.

Whether it’s browsing the web for information or controlling a physical device, each action is a deliberate operation executed by the agent.

For example, an agent assisting with customer service might retrieve customer data, offer support articles, or transfer issues to a human representative.

## [[Types of Agent Actions]]

## [[The Stop and Parse Approach]]

## [[Code Agents]]

We learned that Actions bridge an agent’s internal reasoning and its real-world interactions by executing clear, structured tasks—whether through JSON, code, or function calls.

This deliberate execution ensures that each action is precise and ready for external processing via the stop and parse approach. In the next section, we will explore Observations to see how agents capture and integrate feedback from their environment.

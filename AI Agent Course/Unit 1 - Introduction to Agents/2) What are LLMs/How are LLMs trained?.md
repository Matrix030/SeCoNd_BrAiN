LLMs are trained on large datasets of text, where they learn to predict the next word in a sequence through a self-supervised or masked language modeling objective.

From this unsupervised learning, the model learns the structure of the language and **underlying patterns in text, allowing the model to generalize to unseen data**.

After this initial _pre-training_, LLMs can be fine-tuned on a supervised learning objective to perform specific tasks. For example, some models are trained for conversational structures or tool usage, while others focus on classification or code generation.

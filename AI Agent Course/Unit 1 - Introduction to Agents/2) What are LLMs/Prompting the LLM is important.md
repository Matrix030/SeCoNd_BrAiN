Considering that the only job of an LLM is to predict the next token by looking at every input token, and to choose which tokens are “important”, the wording of your input sequence is very important.

The input sequence you provide an LLM is called _a prompt_. Careful design of the prompt makes it easier **to guide the generation of the LLM toward the desired output**.

Many companies deploy chatbots as agents that interact with customers in natural language.

These agents can answer questions, guide users through troubleshooting steps, open issues in internal databases, or even complete transactions.

Their predefined objectives might include improving user satisfaction, reducing wait times, or increasing sales conversion rates. By interacting directly with customers, learning from the dialogues, and adapting their responses over time, they demonstrate the core principles of an agent in action.

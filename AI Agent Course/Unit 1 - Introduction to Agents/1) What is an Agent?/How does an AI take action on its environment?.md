LLMs are amazing models, but **they can only generate text**.

However, if you ask a well-known chat application like HuggingChat or ChatGPT to generate an image, they can! How is that possible?

The answer is that the developers of HuggingChat, ChatGPT and similar apps implemented additional functionality (called **Tools**), that the LLM can use to create images.

The model used an Image Generation Tool to generate this image.

We will learn more about tools in the [Tools](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/tools) section.

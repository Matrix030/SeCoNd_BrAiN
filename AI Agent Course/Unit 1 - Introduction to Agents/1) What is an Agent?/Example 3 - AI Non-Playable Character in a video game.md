AI agents powered by LLMs can make Non-Playable Characters (NPCs) more dynamic and unpredictable.

Instead of following rigid behavior trees, they can **respond contextually, adapt to player interactions**, and generate more nuanced dialogue. This flexibility helps create more lifelike, engaging characters that evolve alongside the playerâ€™s actions.

![Unit 1 planning](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit1/whiteboard-unit1sub3DONE.jpg)

This course is framework-agnostic because we want to **focus on the concepts of AI agents and avoid getting bogged down in the specifics of a particular framework**.

Also, we want students to be able to use the concepts they learn in this course in their own projects, using any framework they like.

Therefore, for this Unit 1, we will use a dummy agent library and a simple serverless API to access our LLM engine.

You probably wouldn’t use these in production, but they will serve as a good **starting point for understanding how agents work**.

After this section, you’ll be ready to **create a simple Agent** using `smolagents`

And in the following Units we will also use other AI Agent libraries like `LangGraph`, `LangChain`, and `LlamaIndex`.

To keep things simple we will use a simple Python function as a Tool and Agent.

We will use built-in Python packages like `datetime` and `os` so that you can try it out in any environment.

You can follow the process [in this notebook](https://huggingface.co/agents-course/notebooks/blob/main/unit1/dummy_agent_library.ipynb) and **run the code yourself**.

We want to **automatically generate a description of what a tool (Python function or class) does**, just by looking at the code itself.
### ðŸ§° How Will We Do It?
Weâ€™ll use **Python's introspection** â€” a fancy word that just means:
> "Python can look at its own code while itâ€™s running."

That means we can write a Python program that **reads other Python functions** and pulls out information like:
- **Function name** â†’ tells us what the tool is called.
- **Type hints** â†’ tells us what kinds of inputs and outputs the tool expects.
- **Docstring** â†’ a short explanation inside the function that tells us what it does.

### ðŸ§ª What Do We Need From the Original Code?
To make this work, the original tool must:
1. **Use type hints** â†’ like saying `name: str` or `age: int`.
2. **Have a docstring** â†’ like a comment that explains what the function does.
3. **Use clear function names** â†’ like `calculate_total()` instead of `ct()`.

If the code is written this way, then we can write another program that will **read that code** and **automatically generate** a human-readable description of the tool â€” like "This function takes a user's name and age and returns a greeting message."

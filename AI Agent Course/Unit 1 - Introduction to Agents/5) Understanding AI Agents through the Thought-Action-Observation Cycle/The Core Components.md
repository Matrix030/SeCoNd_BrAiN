Agents work in a continuous cycle of: **thinking (Thought) → acting (Act) and observing (Observe)**.

Let’s break down these actions together:

1. **Thought**: The LLM part of the Agent decides what the next step should be.
2. **Action:** The agent takes an action, by calling the tools with the associated arguments.
3. **Observation:** The model reflects on the response from the tool.

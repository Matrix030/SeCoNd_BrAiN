### Model Context Protocol (MCP): a unified tool interface

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an **open protocol** that standardizes how applications **provide tools to LLMs**. MCP provides:

- A growing list of pre-built integrations that your LLM can directly plug into
- The flexibility to switch between LLM providers and vendors
- Best practices for securing your data within your infrastructure

This means that **any framework implementing MCP can leverage tools defined within the protocol**, eliminating the need to reimplement the same tool interface for each framework.

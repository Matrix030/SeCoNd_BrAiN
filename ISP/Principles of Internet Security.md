Here's a focused overview of **internet security and privacy** from the "CS3923 1_Intro" presentation:

### üîê **Core Principles of Internet Security**

1. **CIA Triad** ‚Äì The foundation of cybersecurity:
    
    - **Confidentiality**: Prevent unauthorized access to data.
        
    - **Integrity**: Prevent unauthorized modifications.
        
    - **Availability**: Ensure reliable access to resources.
        
2. **Security Threats and Attacks**
    
    - **Threat**: Potential harm (e.g., hacker activity, software bugs).
        
    - **Vulnerability**: A weakness that allows a threat to occur.
        
    - **Attack**: Action that exploits a vulnerability.
        
3. **Types of Threats**
    
    - **Disclosure**: Unauthorized data access.
        
    - **Deception**: False data accepted.
        
    - **Disruption**: Blocking correct system operation.
        
    - **Usurpation**: Taking unauthorized control.
        
4. **Examples of Real-World Attacks**
    
    - Infected USB sticks stealing credentials.
        
    - GitHub vulnerability leaking private reports.
        
    - Fitbit exposing private user activity data.

### üîê **Internet Privacy Concerns**

1. **Privacy Footprint Awareness** (Assignment 1):
    
    - Request personal data from 10 companies.
        
    - Check if data collection can be opted out.
        
    - Analyze and reflect on what personal data is stored.
        
2. **Modern Examples of Privacy Risks**
    
    - Medical apps with exposed images.
        
    - Sexual activity logged and publicly accessible on fitness apps.
        
    - Site database leaks revealing user data.
        
3. **Security vs. Privacy**
    
    - **Security** protects from malicious actions.
        
    - **Privacy** focuses on control over personal information and its usage.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security Policies & Mechanisms**

1. **Security Policy**
    
    - Defines what is allowed and disallowed.
        
    - Can be mathematical (state-based) or informal.
        
    - Breach occurs when unauthorized states are reached.
        
2. **Security Mechanisms**
    
    - Enforce policies via:
        
        - **Cryptography**
            
        - **Software/hardware controls**
            
        - **Physical controls**
            
3. **Trust Model**
    
    - Trust is built on assumptions, certifications, and enforcement (e.g., FDA analogy).
        
    - Systems must be trusted through design, implementation, and verification.

### ‚ùì **Critical Questions Discussed**

- If data is inferred (not directly leaked), is privacy still violated?
    
- Does releasing a patch improve or harm security (exposes bugs)?
    
- Is using someone‚Äôs unsecured Wi-Fi a privacy breach?

### üß† **Security Mindset & Ethics**

- Start thinking like an attacker (watch DEFCON, BlackHat talks).
    
- Stay ethical‚Äîrespect boundaries while learning vulnerabilities.

Generally speaking, languages that [compile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language) directly to [machine code](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code) produce programs that are faster than [interpreted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_\(computing\)) programs.

_Go is one of the fastest programming languages_, beating JavaScript, Python, and Ruby handily in most benchmarks.

However, Go programs don't run quite as fast as its compiled Rust, Zig, and C counterparts. That said, it _compiles_ much faster than they do, which makes the developer experience super productive. Unfortunately, there are no swordfights on Go teams...

its execution speed is close to java and c# (how many computation per second)

**There is a chunk of code in every go program that manages memory which tends to slow down the execution speed. 

Uses much less memory that java and c# since there is no virtual machine env involved.
